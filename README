Collision avoidance is a broad field and an important technical problem in realizing the holodeck. Due to the breadth and complexity of this problem, considering that one semester is not enough for a very in-depth study, we cannot study it in such a large area. Instead, we will look at how to combine existing collision avoidance research results and make innovations, test the algorithm on Gazebo and evaluate the results. 

Therefore, we subdivided the goal of the entire project into three stages: flying to the target point, detecting and avoiding static obstacles, and detecting and avoiding dynamic obstacles. Among them, static obstacles refer to static obstacles whose positions are known in advance, and dynamic obstacles include sudden moving obstacles and other UAVs that cooperate with each other. The realization difficulty of these three stages increases layer by layer and progresses gradually.

Our project will be realized, the 3D model will be displayed by a combination of several UAVs. Among them, anti-collision is an unavoidable topic, and it is also an important technical issue to realize the holodeck. Due to the breadth and complexity of this problem, we cannot study it on such a large scale, considering that a semester is not deep enough. Instead, we'll look at how to innovate with existing collision avoidance research, looking at the practicality of collision avoidance technology, testing the algorithm on Gazebo and evaluating the results.
