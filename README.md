This project will be able to use in airsim or other platform for path planning. This project implemented algorithms for drones to avoid collision in static obstacles environment.

Traditional algorithm A* and RRT are implemented as baseline algorithm.
AFP is also used to build the environment for training.
MADDPG is the main algorithm used in static environment.
